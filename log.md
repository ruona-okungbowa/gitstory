- Set up project structure (types, components, lib directories)
- Created TypeScript type definitions for all data models
- Updated package.json name to "gitstory"

**Task 2: Database Schema and Supabase Setup**

- Created Supabase project and configured GitHub OAuth provider
- Designed and implemented complete database schema:
  - `users` table (linked to Supabase Auth)
  - `projects` table
  - `generated_content` table
  - `portfolio_scores` table
  - `skill_gaps` table
  - `project_recommendations` table

- Enabled Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Created RLS policies for user data isolation
- Configured environment variables for Supabase connection

**Task 3: Authentication Flow**

- Implemented GitHub OAuth flow with Supabase
- Created API routes:
  - `/api/auth/github` - Initiates OAuth
  - `/api/auth/callback` - Handles OAuth callback and user creation
  - `/api/auth/logout` - Handles user logout
- Built Supabase client utilities (browser and server)
- Created AuthProvider context for global auth state management
- Designed and implemented login page with GitHub OAuth button
- Built UserMenu component with avatar, dropdown, and logout
- Updated root layout with header and auth provider

### 🚧 In Progress

- None currently

### 📝 Next Steps

- Task 4: GitHub Integration
  - Create GitHub API client with Octokit
  - Implement repository fetching
  - Build projects list UI
  - Analyze commit history

### 🐛 Issues Encountered & Resolved

1. **Supabase environment variables not loading**
   - Issue: Wrong variable name (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` vs `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
   - Solution: Fixed variable name and restarted dev server

2. **GitHub OAuth button not working**
   - Issue: Middleware was blocking `/api/auth/github` route
   - Solution: Updated middleware to exclude `/api/auth` routes from authentication check

3. **Avatar images not loading**
   - Issue: Next.js Image component requires hostname configuration
   - Solution: Added `avatars.githubusercontent.com` to `remotePatterns` in next.config.ts

### 📊 Progress

- **Tasks Completed:** 3/22 (13.6%)
- **Estimated Time Spent:** ~6 hours
- **Days Remaining:** 17 days until Dec 5 deadline

### 💡 Notes

- Using Supabase Auth with GitHub OAuth instead of manual JWT handling
- Decided to skip service_role key for now, using RLS policies instead
- Simplified users table to use Supabase Auth ID directly as primary key
- Authentication flow is fully functional and tested

### 🐛 Issues Encountered & Resolved

4. **GitHub token not found error**
   - Issue: `provider_token` wasn't being stored in session
   - Solution: Added `scopes: "read:user user:email repo"` to GitHub OAuth request to get repository access

5. **User foreign key constraint violation**
   - Issue: Projects couldn't be inserted because user didn't exist in `users` table
   - Solution: Updated callback route to create user record in database after OAuth success

6. **Projects not appearing after sync**
   - Issue: Updated projects weren't being added to response array
   - Solution: Modified repos route to push both new and updated projects to response array

7. **Analyse button returning 404**
   - Issue: Analyse route file path had British spelling but frontend used American spelling
   - Solution: Standardised entire codebase to use British English spelling (analyse, analysing, analysed)

8. **Next.js 15+ params error**
   - Issue: Dynamic route params are now async Promises in Next.js 15+
   - Solution: Changed `params: { repoId: string }` to `params: Promise<{ repoId: string }>` and awaited params

9. **Database not updating after analysis**
   - Issue: Typo in column name (`anaysed_at` instead of `analysed_at`)
   - Solution: Fixed typo and added error checking for database updates

### 📊 Progress

- **Tasks Completed:** 4/22 (18.2%)
- **Estimated Time Spent:** ~14 hours total
- **Days Remaining:** 17 days until Dec 5 deadline

### 💡 Notes

- Octokit pagination automatically handles users with many repositories
- GitHub API rate limit: 5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users
- Complexity scoring algorithm provides good differentiation between projects
- British English spelling maintained throughout codebase for consistency
- Next.js 15+ requires awaiting dynamic route params (breaking change from v14)
- Language breakdown API call is expensive (1 call per repo) - consider caching strategy

### 🎯 Key Achievements Today

- Complete authentication system with GitHub OAuth
- Full database schema with RLS policies
- Working GitHub integration with 17 repos synced
- Functional project analysis with complexity scoring
- Professional UI with responsive design

    - Sorts by priority score descending (validates Property 6)
    - `findMatchingSkills()` - Case-insensitive partial matching
    - `getTopRecommendations()` - Returns top N recommendations
    - `filterByDifficulty()` - Filters by difficulty level
    - `filterByCategory()` - Filters by category

    - Validates Property 6 (sorted by priority)

### 🐛 Issues Encountered & Resolved

15. **Templates not matching skill gaps**
    - Issue: `skillsTaught` had implementation details (e.g., "DOM manipulation") but role requirements expected technologies (e.g., "React", "TypeScript")
    - Solution: Updated all 24 templates to include technology names in `skillsTaught` arrays

16. **No essential skills being filled**
    - Issue: None of the templates taught TypeScript or Testing
    - Solution: Added TypeScript and Testing to 6 intermediate/advanced templates (Pomodoro Timer, 24hr Story, Task Manager, Blogging Platform, Expense Tracker, Job Board)

17. **JSON import type error**
    - Issue: JSON structure was `{ "templates": [...] }` but code tried to use it as array
    - Solution: Changed import to access `.templates` property: `templatesData.templates`

18. **TypeScript strict mode errors**
    - Issue: Using `Object.keys()` returned string[] instead of ProjectTemplate[]
    - Solution: Return the filtered array directly, not `Object.keys()`
